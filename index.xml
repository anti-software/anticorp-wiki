Learn how to setup printing services on Arch Linux for HP based printers connected via USB
This is mostly for hplip dependent printers, usually there&amp;rsquo;s a package for your printer either on aur or the official repositories. Check the wiki before you follow this guide. The content was written well over 2 years ago, as a more of a &amp;ldquo;note&amp;rdquo; rather than being a &amp;ldquo;tutorial/guide&amp;rdquo;.
Connect your printer Installing CUPS and other required stuff $ pacman -S cups $ systemctl enable cups $ systemctl start cups $ pacman -S hplip $ hp-setup -i Follow steps and download plugin and it should work.</description></item><item><title>Compilers</title><link>https://info.antisoftware.net/docs/learning-resources/compilers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://info.antisoftware.net/docs/learning-resources/compilers/</guid><description>Compilers # Resources # acwj: A Compiler Writing Journey [GitHub] Low-Level Software Security for Compiler Developers: [GitHub] [Book] Compiler Infographics: [Link] Learning how to write a LLVM pass: 2019 LLVM Developers’ Meeting: A.
